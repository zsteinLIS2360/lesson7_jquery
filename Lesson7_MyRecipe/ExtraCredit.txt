1)In myRecipe I changes the h3 headers to have an orange background and then a yellow background as you hover over them.
2)For the animation I toggled the width instead of the height.
3)You must click on the headers to open them, rather than hover.
4)I added the ability to have a yellow highlight over ingredients as you hover over them.
5) I also centered the headers on the page
